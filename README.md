# Biquadris-Tetris-

The source code is available to view upon request, but is not open to the public due to Policy 71 of the University of Waterloo.

This game was written in solely C++ and uses object-oriented programming concepts learned throughout the term.

This is a two player game, where the two players take turns placing thier blocks and the first person to lose, loses. The rules and workings are very similar to Tetris. Players also have the option to play 5 different levels, each of which bringing their own difficultues.

There are also other features, upon clearing two rows players can cause a special effect on the other player. 
One of the feautres is 'Blind' (shown below) which essentially blinds a portion of the board for the other player until they finish their turn.
